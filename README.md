# C# Design Patterns
Fully functioning sample code for the C# Design Patterns course over at Pluralsight, currently targeting .NET 8.

The **main** branch exactly matches the course.
The **latest-and-greatest** branch contains changes that were incorporated after recording.  Most often these changes are language features that are relativley new and/or in preview, like file-scoped namespaces, primary constructors, switch expressions and so on.
